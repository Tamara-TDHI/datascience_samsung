Assignment on data science track Coursera: accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

This project is an assignment of the module Getting and Cleaning data of the Coursera/Johns Hopkings data science track

The script consists of the following steps:

Step 0: download the data. Since the programming assignment states that it is assumed that the raw data is already in the 
working file, I changed these steps into comments.

Step 1: unzips the test and training set from the raw data, reads them into R tables and combines the data into 1 set

Step 2: extract relevant info mean and standard 

To be continued ...

Dear fellow coursera student... I apologise, this work is obviously not nearly finished!
